* On the whole, charter schools outperformed district schools. The 5 highest performing schools were charter schools, while the 5 lowest performing schools were district schools. Some of this effect may be due to the fact that charter schools tend to be smaller than district schools.

* There does not appear to be a significant correlation between read/reading scores and grade-level. The schools themselves seem to have a larger impact than grade level on math and reading achievement.

* There appears to be a negative correlation between per-student spending and average math/ reading scores. Schools with less spending tend to have the higher scores. This may be related to the fact that larger schools tend to have higher per student spending, and larger schools tend to perform worse than smaller schools.

* Small and medium size schools tend to outperform large schoools. 89.88% of students at small schools and 90.62% of students at medium schools were passing compared to 58.29% of students at large schools.
